                    <p>LOWELL — A Tewksbury mother who was active in her church and worked for a Cambridge design firm was killed Sunday in the massacre at the country music festival in Las Vegas, grieving family members said Monday.</p>
                    <p>Rhonda LeRocque was at the outdoor concert with her husband, Jason, and their young daughter when a gunman opened fire, killing her and at least 58 others, according to her sister, Jennifer Zelenski. The husband and daughter escaped unharmed, Zelenski said.</p>
                    <p>Rhonda LeRocque’s grandmother, Carol Marquis, said Jason LeRocque’s father had bought the family tickets for the concert.</p>
                    <p>“All I know is someone started shooting and people are running and she got shot in the head,” Marquis said Monday. “And we lost a dear, close, good person — one of the nicest people you will ever meet in your life.”</p>

                    <p>LAS VEGAS — Jake Velzl and his wife were standing in the tightly packed crowd when the shooting started. As people ran screaming, they dove to the ground. Looking back, they saw someone get shot, standing right where they had been.</p>
                    <p>“When we left, the person that took our spot got hit,” Velzl recalled on Monday, the day after the massacre that left at least 59 people dead and more than 500 injured. “It sounded like at first fireworks, and once you realized it wasn’t that, we had to get everybody down. Then we got up and ran and hid if we could. And that’s what we did to get out of there.”</p>
                    <p>The couple came from Orange County, Calf., to see the outdoor music festival, which they had attended two years ago. As of mid-afternoon, they had not heard from a friend who went to the concert but was not standing near them when the gunman opened fire.</p>
                    <p>“We don’t know if he got out or not,” he said.</p>

                    <p>In the wake of the deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas on Sunday night that left at least 58 people dead and more than 500 injured, the Josh Abbott Band — like many country acts — posted a message that sent thoughts and prayers to the victims. The Texas-based group performed at the Route 91 Harvest festival Sunday afternoon, several hours before a gunman fired into the crowd during Jason Aldean’s set.</p>
                    <p>‘‘I’ll never unhear those gunshots; and our band & crew will never forget how that moment made them feel. Our hearts are with all the victims,’’ he posted on Twitter.</p>
                    <p>However, one member of the band went even further, posting a lengthy message on Twitter about his personal response to the attack. After spending the night fearing for his life, Caleb Keeter, the group’s lead guitarist, spoke up about gun control.</p>
                    <p>‘‘I’ve been a proponent of the 2nd amendment my entire life. Until the events of last night. I cannot express how wrong I was. We actually have members of our crew with [Concealed Handgun Licenses], and legal firearms on the bus,’’ Keeter wrote. ‘‘They were useless.’’ He continued:</p>
